- Fix inconsistencies of _olo_intf_i2c_master_ generic default values compared to documentation
  - There was a mismatch for _CmdTimeout_g_

## 1.1.0

15-Jun-2024

### Added Features

- _olo_intf_i2c_master_
  - I2C master
  - Multi-Master and clock-stretching capable

### Bugfixes (Backward Compatible)

- Change default _UserTransactionSizeBits_g_ in _olo_axi_master_simple_ to 24 bits
  - The combination of default values before was illegal
  - Backwards compatible because the default values had to be overwritten for successful compilation before the change
    anyways.
- Change default values of _AlmFullLevel_g_ and _AlmEmptyLevel_g_ to 0
  - Using another generic (_Depth_g_) as default value for generics is illegal.
  - Backwards compatible because the default values had to be overwritten for successful compilation before the change
    anyways.
- Fix _AxiDataWidth_g_ related assertions in _olo_axi_lite_slave_
  - Backwards compatible because the change only adds error messages for anyways illegal generics combinations
