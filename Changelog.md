# Changelog

## 2.1.0 

30-Jul-2024

### Added Features

* Efinix Efinity integration
  * Script to automatically import all *Open Logic* features into an *Efinity* project
  * Addition of synthesis attributes for *Efinity*
  * *Efinity* tutorial
* Added *FuseSoC* package manager support
* *olo_intf_spi_master*
  * SPI master

### Backward Compatible Changes

* Various documentation improvements
* Various optimizations on the CI/CD infrastructure


### Non Backward Compatible Changes

* None


### Bugfixes (Backward Compatible)

* Fixed sensitivity list in *olo_axi_master_simple* (#41)
  * *M_Axi_RResp* was missing
  * Credits to [kuriousd](https://github.com/kuriousd) for reporting
* Process scoped constraints *late* for AMD Vivado
  * User constraints must be processed before scoped constraints, otherwise clocks are not known to scoped constraints

## 2.0.0 

06-Jul-2024

### Added Features

* Altera Quartus integration
  * Script to automatically import all *Open Logic* features into a Quartus project
* Added tutorials
  * Vivado Verilog tutorial
  * Quartus VHDL tutorial
  * Quartus Verilog tutorial

* *olo_base_reset_gen*
  * Reset generator (and synchronizer)
* *olo_base_flowctrl_handler*
  * Allows to add flow-control (ready) around entities without flow-control (valid only)

### Backward Compatible Changes

* Various documentation improvements


### Non Backward Compatible Changes

* Removed *t_aslv* (array of unconstrained std_logic_vector) from *olo_base_pkg_array* 
  * Arrays of unconstrained types are not accepted by Quartus


### Bugfixes (Backward Compatible)

* None

## 1.2.0 

27-Jun-2024

### Added Features

* AMD Vivado integration
  * Script to automatically import all *Open Logic* features into a Vivado project
  * Vivado tutorial
* *olo_intf_clk_meas*
  * Measure the frequency of a clock signal (based on a clock with a known frequency)
* *olo_intf_debounce*
  * Debouncing for external signals (e.g. inputs from switches or buttons)

### Backward Compatible Changes

* Various documentation improvements
* Execute scoped constraint scripts in separate namespaces
  * This avoids unwanted interactions between the script through global variables


### Non Backward Compatible Changes

* None

### Bugfixes (Backward Compatible)

* Fix scoped constraints for *olo_intf_sync*
  * Incomplete input delays were reported before the fix  
* Fix inconsistencies of *olo_intf_i2c_master* generic default values compared to documentation
  * There was a mismatch for *CmdTimeout_g*
  * *ClkFrequency_g* had a default value in the implementation before the change (which is wrong because the clock is specific to the design)

## 1.1.0 

15-Jun-2024

### Added Features

* *olo_intf_i2c_master* 
  * I2C master
  * Multi-Master and clock-stretching capable
* *olo_intf_sync*
  * Double stage synchronizer for asynchronous external signals
  * Includes scoped timing constraints
* *olo_axi_master_full*
  * AXI Master with support for unaligned and odd-sized transfers (other sizes than multiple of AXI words) 

### Backward Compatible Changes

* Various documentation improvements
* Added *Rd_Last* signal to *olo_axi_master_simple* to simplify handling of read-data.
* *olo_base_wconv_n2xn* now supports InWidth=OutWidth

### Non Backward Compatible Changes

* None

### Bugfixes (Backward Compatible)

* Change default *UserTransactionSizeBits_g* in *olo_axi_master_simple* to 24 bits
  * The combination of default values before was illegal
  * Backwards compatible because the default values had to be overwritten for successful compilation before the change anyways.
* Change default values of *AlmFullLevel_g* and *AlmEmptyLevel_g* to 0
  * Using another generic (*Depth_g*) as default value for generics is illegal.
  * Backwards compatible because the default values had to be overwritten for successful compilation before the change anyways.
* Fix *AxiDataWidth_g* related assertions in *olo_axi_lite_slave*
  * Backwards compatible because the change only adds error messages for anyways illegal generics combinations
