VHDL Source: [olo_fix_sim_stimuli](../../src/fix/vhdl/olo_fix_sim_stimuli.vhd)
VUnit Variant: [olo_test_fix_stimuli_vc](../../test/tb/olo_test_fix_stimuli_vc.vhd)
Bit-true Model: N/A
Python co-simulation file writer: [olo_fix_cosim](../../src/fix/python/olo_fix/olo_fix_cosim.py)

## Description

This entity reads content of a co-simulation file writen by _olo_fix_cosim_ from Python and applies the data to a DUT
in a simulation as shown below.

![Figure](./principles/olo_fix_cosim.drawio.png)

The file to play as well as the stalling pattern (optional) can be configured through generics.

The component can work as timing-master (driving the stalling pattern by pulling _Valid_ low) or timing-slave (apply
data according to the activity on _Ready_/_Valid_ driven by other components). This feature is used when a DUT has
multiple data inputs. A test-bench then usually contains one _olo_fix_sim_stimuli_ component per input. one configured
as timing-master and all others configured as timing-slave.

**Note:** The pure VHDL componend _olo_fix_sim_stimuli_ does play the file selected once and then wait. If you need
more options, consider switching to VUnit.

For details about the fixed-point number format used in _Open Logic_, refer to the
[fixed point principles](./olo_fix_principles.md).

### VUnit Variant

For VUnit users, a more elaborate variant of this component exists:
[olo_test_fix_stimuli_vc](../../test/tb/olo_test_fix_stimuli_vc.vhd)

The VUnit variant of the component allows to trigger the playback of files through a procedure call. As a result,
multiple files can be played one after the other or the same file can be played several times. For every playback
run the stalling pattern can be configured individually.

| IsTimingMaster_g   | boolean  | true    | true: Component acts as timing-master<br />false: Component acts as timing-slave |
| Fmt_g              | string   | -       | Fixed point format of the signal to generate. Must match the format written into the co-simulation file on the Python side.<br />String representation of an _en_cl_fix Format_t_ (e.g. "(1,1,15)") |
| StallProbability_g | real     | 0.0     | Stall probability (0.0 = never stall, 1.0 = always stall).<br />Only used for _IsTimingMaster_g=true_ |
| StallMaxCycles_g   | positive | 1       | Maximum number of clock-cycles to pull _Valid_ low when stalling.<br />Only used for _IsTimingMaster_g=true_ |
| StallMinCycles_g   | positive | 1       | Minimum number of clock-cycles to pull _Valid_ low when stalling.<br />Only used for _IsTimingMaster_g=true_ |

## Interfaces

### Control

| Name | In/Out | Length | Default | Description                                     |
| :--- | :----- | :----- | ------- | :---------------------------------------------- |

| Rst  | in     | 1      | -       | Reset input (high-active, synchronous to _Clk_) |

### Output Data

| Name  | In/Out | Length         | Default | Description                                                  |

| Valid | inout  | 1              | N/A     | AXI-S handshaking signal for _Data_<br /><br />Acts as **output** for **IsTimingMaster_g=true**<br />Acts as **input** for **IsTimingMaster_g=false** |
| Ready | in     | 1              | '1'     | AXI-S handshaking signal for _Data_<br />                    |

**Note:** In Timing-Slave mode, the _Valid_ signal _MUST_ be connected to the _Valid_ signal generated by the
Timing-Master. It cannot be left unconnected.
