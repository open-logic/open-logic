# Libero Tutorial

## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is give users a kick-start on creating Microchip Libero projects using *Open Logic*.

The tutorial covers project setup and implementation up to the production of a running bitstream for a small design. The design is rather hardware independent but all examples and pinout constraints are given for a [ICICLE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/mpfs-icicle-kit-es) evaluation board. If want to use it on some other hardware, just change pinout and the target device accordingly.

The steps should be very much independent of the Libero version but all screenshots are taken with version v2024.2.

## Step 1: Project setup

First, create a new project.

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/create_project_01.png)

On the first page of the dialog, choose any project name and folder you like.

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/create_project_02.png)

As part, choose the FPGA on the ICICLE: **MPFS250T_ES-FCVG484E**

Note that this is an engineering sample part (*_ES*). Future board revisions probably will contain the series part **MPFS250T-FCVG484E**. Choose the exact part on your board - otherwise the programming tools may refuse to program the bitstream generated.

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/create_project_03.png)

You can now forward through the next three pages without changes or simply press the *Finish* button.

## Step 2: Integrate Open Logic

We follow the steps described also in the [HowTo...](../HowTo.md) document. They are repeated here, so you do not have to open the *HowTo* document separately.

Open the dialog to run scripts:

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/integrate_olo_01.png)

Then select the script in *\<open-logic-root>/tools/libero/import_sources.tcl* and run it **without any arguments for the VHDL** tutorial.

Pass the **argument *lib=work* for the Verilog** tutorial. This is required because Libero resp. SynplifyPro searches for VHDL entities only in the library *work* when they are instantiated from Verilog.

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/integrate_olo_02.png)

You should now see a number of source files being added to the project - all of them compiled into the library *olo*. The exact number of source files may vary as *Open Logic* still grows.

![Screenshot](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/integrate_olo_03.png)

That's it,  *Open Logic* is now ready to be used.

## Step 3: Build FPGA Design

### Overview

In this tutorial we will build the following design:

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/LiberoTutorial.svg)

This design slightly differs from the normal reference design because the ICICLE board does only have four buttons and one of them is required to be used as reset input, because Microchip PolarFire FPGAs do not support defining the FF initialization state (see [olo_base_reset_gen](../base/olo_base_reset_gen.md) documentation).

All *Open Logic* blocks are shown in grey. Custom logic is shown in blue.

*Switch[3]* is used as reset - when it is pressed the design is reset (it must be pressed once before the design is functional). *olo_base_reset_gen* is used to synchronize the reset. 

The design does de-bounce all four switches resp. buttons. 

Every time the user presses *Switch[2]*, the counter is incremented. Every time the user presses *Switch[0]*, the state of the counter is written into a FIFO (4 bits wide, 4096 entries deep). Every time the user presses *Switch[1]*, one FIFO entry is read and applied to the LEDs. Note that clock and reset are not shown in the figure for simplicity reasons.

The de-bouncing is required to ensure that a button press really only produces one edge (and hence one read/write transaction to the FIFO resp. a single increment of the counter). 

The design is super simple - it is not meant for demonstrating the coolest features of *Open Logic* but for being the simplest possible example of a design making use of *Open Logic*.

### Add Source Code

The code is provided in the file [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd](./LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd). 

If you are using Verilog, use the system verilog source file: [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.sv](./LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.sv). 

Add this file to the project as follows:

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_sources_01.png)

Navigate to the file [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd](./LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd) and link it. Linking instead of importing the file is chosen, so the file is referenced in its original location and not copied into the project folder.

If you are using Verilog, use the system verilog source file: [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.sv](./LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.sv). 

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_sources_02.png)

You should now see the source-file being added.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_sources_03.png)

To set the file as root (top-level), first the design hierarchy must be built.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_sources_04.png)

The file can then be selected as root from the right-click menu. 

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_sources_05.png)

After selecting the root, the yellow *Please select a root* warning disappears and the file is marked as root by displaying it in bold letters.

### Add Constraints

The required pinout for the ICICLE board is provided int the PDC file  [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/pinout.pdc](./LiberoTutorial/Files/pinout.pdc). You can link this file through the same dialog used for the source file already (*File > Link Files > Link Files*). Just make sure you select file type *.pdc in the dialog so you can select the file.

**Note:** For unknown reasons sometimes Libero does not allow to *link* *.pdc files. If you run into this situation just use *File > Import Files > Import Files* instead - be aware that this command creates a copy of the *.pdf file inside the project folder.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_constraints_01.png)

Next a minimal set of timing constraints is added. The constraint file only defines the clock frequency in this case - not what is state of the art for a real design but sufficient for the tutorial.

The timing constraints are provided in the SDC file [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/constraints.sdc](./LiberoTutorial/Files/constraints.sdc). Again, make sure you select the correct file type. 

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_constraints_02.png)

By default Libero does not use the freshly imported constraints. This can be changed through the *Manage Constraints* dialog from the *Design Flow* tab. Open it by double-clicking.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_constraints_03.png)

First enable the I/O constraints (the PDC file) to be used during Place and Route. Then save the setting by pressing the *Save* button.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_constraints_04.png)

Then do the same for the timing constraints (the SDC file), just that this file shall be used for all steps of the tool-flow.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/add_constraints_05.png)



### Build Design

Build the design and generate a bitstream. You can just double-click the *Export Bitstream* option - Libero will detect automatically run all required steps of the flow, which takes some time.

Any dialogs showing up can be confirmed without changes.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/build_01.png)

After successful compilation, Libero automatically displays the resulting reports

### Analyze Resource Utilization

From the resource utilization it is obvious that the FIFO was correctly mapped to Block-RAM (LSRAM, Large SRAM, 20kb).

The overall LUT count of the design is 183 LUT.

The LUT usage also demonstrates the efficiency of *Open Logic*: If the de-bouncing would be implemented in the most simple form (one counter per signal running on the system clock directly), the de-bouncing alone would use 84 LUTs (4 signals x 25ms @ 50 MHz --> 84 counter bits) but thanks to clever design the LUT count here is only 70.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/resources_01.png)

### Analyze Timing

Timing analysis must be launched manually in Libero by double-clicking *Verify Timing*.

The timing report shows that unsurprisingly the slow clock-speed of the 50 MHz clock is met. It also shows missing output and input delays - which is acceptable for a tutorial but should be fixed by adding constraints in a real-world project.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: For Libero scoped constraints do not work and all constraints must be entered manually (see documentation of individual components that require constraints like interface components and clock crossings). 

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/timing_01.png)



## Step 4: Try it on Hardware

Now connect your [ICICLE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/mpfs-icicle-kit-es) hardware to your PC using the USB cable.

The ICICLE board is programmed through a separate application *FlashPro Express*, which is installed together with Libero. To program the bitstream, it must be exported as a FlashPro Express Job by double-clicking the related option. Any dialogs popping up can be confirmed without changes.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/run_01.png)

Now open *FlashPro Express*.

**Note for Linux users:** You first have to run the FlashPro Express environment installation as root `sudo <libero-install-dir>/bin/fp6_env_install` and for unknown reasons FlashPro Express must be executed as root as well to work correctly `sudo <libero-install-dir>/bin/FPExpress`.

In FlashPro Express, create a new Job Project.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/run_02.png)

Now select the exported *.job file (see next screenshot). You can choose any empty folder as destination for the project.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/run_03.png)

The exported *.job file can be found in the folder *\<project-folder\>/designer/libero_tutorial/export*.

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/run_04.png)

To program the device, simply press the prominent *Run* button with the option *Program* selected (default).

![Design](./LiberoTutorial/Pictures/run_05.png)

First you must reset the design (press *Switch[3]*), you then you can increment the counter (press *Switch[2]*) and write (*Switch[0]*) a few counter values into the FIFO. The values can then be displayed on the the LEDs one by one by pressing *Switch[1]*.

## Step 5: Discussion of the VHDL Source Code

The source code can be found in the file [\<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd](./LiberoTutorial/Files/libero_tutorial.vhd). 

Not every line of the source code is discussed. It is simple and implements the design described earlier. Only a few details worth mentioning are discussed.

The source code samples given are VHDL - however, for the verilog example file the code looks very much the same and the comments apply as well.

### Omitting Unused Generics

The FIFO instance only sets two generics:

```
    i_fifo : entity olo.olo_base_fifo_sync
        generic map ( 
            Width_g         => 4,               
            Depth_g         => 4096                 
        )
        ...
```

The *olo_base_fifo_sync* entity would have much more generics but due to the concept of providing default values for optional generics, it is not necessary to obfuscate source-code with many lines of actually unused generics.

```
entity olo_base_fifo_sync is
    generic ( 
        Width_g         : positive;                   
        Depth_g         : positive;                  
        AlmFullOn_g     : boolean   := false;        
        AlmFullLevel_g  : natural   := 0;                   
        AlmEmptyOn_g    : boolean   := false;        
        AlmEmptyLevel_g : natural   := 0;                   
        RamStyle_g      : string    := "auto";       
        RamBehavior_g   : string    := "RBW";        
        ReadyRstState_g : std_logic := '1'
    );
    ...
```

### Omitting Unused Ports

The same concept applies to unused ports. In this case we do neither require full handshaking nor status signals like Full/Empty/Level - hence all these signals can be omitted:

```
    i_fifo : entity olo.olo_base_fifo_sync
        ...
        port map (    
              Clk           => Clk,
              Rst           => Rst,
              In_Data       => Data,
              In_Valid      => RisingEdges(0),
              Out_Data      => Led,
              Out_Ready     => RisingEdges(1)              
        );
```

Again compared to the full list of signals the *olo_base_fifo_sync* provides many lines of obfuscating code can be omitted because all optional input ports come with default values.

```
entity olo_base_fifo_sync is
    ...
    port (    
        -- Control Ports
          Clk           : in  std_logic;
          Rst           : in  std_logic;
          -- Input Data
          In_Data       : in  std_logic_vector(Width_g - 1 downto 0);
          In_Valid      : in  std_logic                                             := '1';
          In_Ready      : out std_logic;
          In_Level      : out std_logic_vector(log2ceil(Depth_g + 1) - 1 downto 0);
          -- Output Data
          Out_Data      : out std_logic_vector(Width_g - 1 downto 0);
          Out_Valid     : out std_logic;
          Out_Ready     : in  std_logic                                             := '1';
          Out_Level     : out std_logic_vector(log2ceil(Depth_g + 1) - 1 downto 0);
          -- Status
          Full          : out std_logic; 
          AlmFull       : out std_logic;
          Empty         : out std_logic; 
          AlmEmpty      : out std_logic
          
    );
```



## Notes

If you should want to build the tutorial project without many manual mouse clicks, you can do so by following the steps below:

* Open a shell

* In the shell, navigate to the directory \<open-logic-root\>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files
  ```
  cd <open-logic-root>/doc/tutorials/LiberoTutorial/Files
  ```

* Run the script [scripted_build.tcl](./LiberoTutorial/Files/scripted_build.tcl), which creates and builds the tutorial project: For VHDL:
  
  ```
  libero script:scripted_build.tcl
  ```
  
  For Verilog:
  
  ```
  libero script_scripted_build_sv.tcl
  ```

Note: replace \<open-logic-root\> with the root folder of your *Open Logic* working copy.
