VHDL Source: [olo_base_reset_gen](../../src/base/vhdl/olo_base_reset_gen.vhd)

## Description

This component generates reset pulses of a specified minimum duration after FPGA configuration and optionally upon request (reset input).

The component dues guarantee synchronous de-assertion of the reset. It might assert the reset asynchronously.

**Note:** Because the reset input is detected asynchronously, it is important that this input is glitch-free.

The block comes with automatic constraints. For manual constraining, a `set_max_delay -datapath_only` or a `set_false_path` constraint is required for the *RstIn* input (if it is used).

**Note:** Automatic constraining currently only works for *AMD* tools (*Vivado*) and the usage in VHDL. Manual constraints are required for Verilog or other tools.

**WARNING:** Reset assertion upon FPGA configuration relies on the **target technology supporting specific FF initialization state**. For the most common target technologies (namely AMD and altera) this is given. However, for technologies which do not support specifying FF initialization state (e.g. Microchip devices) an external reset signal must be connected to *RstIn* - *RstOut* will not be asserted upon FPGA configuration. If in doubt, refer to the the documentation of your target technology or play it safe and connect *RstIn*.

## Generics

| Name               | Type      | Default | Description                                                  |
| :----------------- | :-------- | ------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| RstPulseCycles_g   | positive  | 3       | Minimum duration of the reset pulse in clock cycles<br />Range: 3 ... 2^31-1 |
| RstInPolarity_g    | std_logic | '1'     | Polarity of *RstIn*.<br />'1' - Active High<br />'0' - Active Low |
| AsyncResetOutput_g | boolean   | false   | True = *RstOut* is asserted asynchronously (*RstIn* is forwarded even in absence of *Clk* activity)<br />False = *RstOut* may be asserted synchronously (upon *Clk* rising edge).<br />Note that for short reset pulses (*RstPulseCycles_g*=3) the output is always asserted synchronously. The generic is meant to enforce asynchronous assertion even for longer pulses. |

## Interfaces

| Name   | In/Out | Length | Default               | Description                                                  |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clk    | in     | 1      | -                     | Clock                                                        |
| RstOut | out    | 1      | -                     | Reset output (high-active, synchronous to Clk)<br />**Note**: The output is always high-active according to *Open Logic* guidelines. |
| RstIn  | in     | 1      | not *RstInPolarity_g* | Reset input. The reset is detected asynchronously - any glitches on this signal lead to a reset pulse being generated.<br />The input is optional. If reset shall only be asserted after FPGA configuration, it can be left floating (limited to target technologies supporting specifying the FF initialization state). |

## Architecture

The architecture of the block is shown in the figure below:

![architecture](./misc/olo_base_reset_gen.svg)

The reset is detected asynchronously. If the *RstIn* input matches *RstInPolarity_g*, the reset synchronizer FFs are asynchronously set. A synchronous counter is then used to prolong the reset pulse to the required duraton.

Because the synchronous counter asserts its reset output only upon *Clk* edges, an additional OR (red) is added at the output when *AsyncResetOutput_g* is enabled.
