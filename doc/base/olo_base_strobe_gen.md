## Description

This component generates pulse at a fixed frequency. It optionally allows synchronization of those events to an input.

In the most simple use-case, single cycle pulses are generated free-running at a fixed frequency. To achieve this,
_Out_Ready_ and _In_Sync_ can be left unconnected. Bellow figure depicts this situation for _FreqClkHz_g=5e6_ and
_FreqStrobeHz_g=1e6_.

Additionally the strobe phase can be synchronized to _In_Sync_. In this case, the event is synchronized to the rising
edge of the _In_Sync_ input.

If the _Out_Ready_ signal is connected, _Out_Valid_ stays asserted until _Out_Ready_ and _Out_Valid_ are asserted at the
same time (AXI4-Stream hanshaking). Note that in this case, the rising edges of _Out_Valid_ occur at _FreqStrobeHz_g_
independently of how long the signal stays asserted.

However, _Out_Ready_ and _In_Sync_ are optional signals and can be left unconnected in the standard-case where just a
pulse with a known frequency is required.

The strobe generator by default works in _aequidistant mode_: It produces _Out_Valid_ pulses that are always the same
number of clock-cycles apart from each other. This has the down-side of the output strobe period being off by up to half
a clock period - which finally leads to a slightly shifted frequency.

Alternatively the strobe generator can be used in _fractional mode_ (by setting _FractionalMode_g=true_). In this mode,
the strobe generator does vary the time between _Out_Valid_ pulses by one clock cycle to meet the _FreqStrobeHz_g_ with
less than 1% of error _on average_ (over a long time).

Use _fractional mode_ if _FreqStrobeHz_g_ is relatively close to _FreqClkHz_g_ and the exact strobe frequency is
important.

Use _aequidistant mode_ if a constant number of clock cycles between _Out_Valid_ pulses is required.
