VHDL Source: [olo_base_ram_sdp](../../src/base/vhdl/olo_base_ram_sdp.vhd)

## Description

This component implements a **simple dual-port** RAM. It offers separate read and write ports.

By default read and write port both run on the same clock but optionally the implementation with separate read/write clocks is supported.

The RAM is implemented in pure VHDL but in a way that allows tools to implement it in block-RAMs.

## Generics

| Name            | Type     | Default | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------- | ------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Depth_g         | positive | -       | Number of addresses the RAM has                              |
| Width_g         | positive | -       | Number of bits stored per address (word-width)               |
| UseByteEnable_g | boolean  | false   | By default, all bits of a memory cell are written. Enabling byte-enables allows to control which bytes are written individually. <br>The setting is only allows for if *Width_g* is a multiple of eight (otherwise the word *byte-enable* does not make sense). |
| IsAsync_g       | boolean  | false   | By default read- and write-port both use the samle clock *Clk*. <br>By settings *IsAsync_g*=true, an asynchronous RAM is implemented where the write-port use *Clk* and the read-port uses *Rd_Clk*. |
| RdLatency_g     | positive | 1       | Read latency. <br>1 is the behavior of a normal synchronous RAM<br>Higher values can be desirable for timing-optimization in high-speed logic. |
| RamStyle_g      | string   | "auto"  | Through this generic, the exact resource to use for implementation can be controlled. This generic is applied to the attributes *ram_style* and *ramstyle* which vendors offer to control RAM implementation. Commonly used values are given below.<br>AMD: "auto", block", "distributed", "ultra" - see [ug901](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug901-vivado-synthesis/RAM_STYLE?tocId=EWhb59DDWEWsMr4arnAICw) for details<br>Intel: "M4K", "M9K", "M20K", "M144K", "MLAB" - see [quartus-help](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/quartushelp/17.0/hdl/vhdl/vhdl_file_dir_ram.htm) for details<br />Efinix: "block_ram", "registers" - see [efinity-synthesis](https://www.efinixinc.com/docs/efinity-synthesis-v3.9.pdf) for details |
| RamBehavior     | string   | "RBW"   | Controls the RAM behavior. Must match the behavior of RAM resources of the target technology for efficient implementation.<br>"RBW": Read-before-write - more common common, hence the default <br>"WBR": Write-before-read<br>If you are unsure what behavior your target device offers, try both settings and check which one is correctly mapped to RAM resources using the synthesis report. |

## Interfaces

| Name    | In/Out | Length                | Default | Description                                                  |

| Wr_Addr | in     | ceil(log2(*Depth_g*)) | -       | Write address                                                |
| Wr_Be   | in     | *Width_g*/8           | All '1' | Byte-enables<br>Ignored if *UseByteEnable_g* = false         |
| Wr_Ena  | in     | 1                     | '1'     | Write enable. The memory cell at *Wr_Addr* is written only if *Wr_Ena*='1'. |

| Rd_Clk  | in     | 1                     | '0'     | Read-clock - Only used if *IsAsync_g*=true, otherwise *Clk* is used for the read-port. |
| Rd_Addr | in     | ceil(log2(*Depth_g*)) | -       | Read address                                                 |
