## Description

This component implements a pipeline stage for AXI4 interfaces. The component registers all signals of the interface.

Note that the component can be used for AXI4-Lite by simply leaving all unused signals unconnected.

## Generics

| Name        | Type     | Default | Description                                                  |
| :---------- | :------- | ------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stages_g    | positive | 1       | Number of register stages to insert                          |
| AddrWidth_g | positive | 32      | With of the _AwAddr_ and _ArAddr_ signals in bits.           |
| DataWidth_g | positive | 32      | Width of the _WData_ and _RData_ signals in bits             |
| IdWidth_g   | natural  | 0       | Width of the signals _AwId_, _ArId_, _BId_ and _RId_ signals in bits. |
| UserWidth_g | natural  | 0       | Width of the siginals _AwUser_, _ArUser_, _WUser_, _BUser_ and _RUser_ in bits. |

## Interfaces

### Control

| Name | In/Out | Length | Default | Description                                     |
| :--- | :----- | :----- | ------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Clk  | in     | 1      | -       | Clock                                           |
| Rst  | in     | 1      | -       | Reset input (high-active, synchronous to _Clk_) |

### AXI Interfaces

| Name  | In/Out | Length | Default | Description                                                  |
| :---- | :----- | :----- | ------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| S_... | *      | *      | *       | AXI4 slave interface. For the exact meaning of the signals, refer to the AXI protocol specification. |
| M_... | *      | *      | *       | AXI4 master interface. For the exact meaning of the signals, refer to the AXI protocol specification. |

Transaction requests are forwarded from the slave interface to the master interfaces. Responses are forwarded from the
master interface to the slave interface.

## Architecture

The entity is based on the [olo_base_pl_stage](../base/olo_base_pl_stage.md) entity. One such entity is used for every
one of the 5 channels AXI4 has.
