# Open Logic - A VHDL Standard Library

*Open Logic* aims to be for HDL projects what what *stdlib* is for C/C++ projects. 

*Open Logic* implements commonly used components in a reusable and vendor/tool-independent way and provide them under a permissive open source license (LGPL modified for FPGA usage, see [License.txt](./License.txt)), so the code can be used in commercial projects. 

*Open Logic* is written in VHDL but can also be used from System Verilog easily. 

Browse the [**Entity List**](./doc/EntityList.md) to see what is available.

Maintainer: [obruendl](oliver.bruendler@gmx.ch)

## Structure

*Open Logic* is split into the following areas. You might use all of them or only the ones you need.

* [base](./doc/EntityList.md#base) - basic logic to be used for device internal logic
* [axi](./doc/EntityList.md#axi)  - any components related to AXI4/AXI4-Lite/AXI4-Stream interfaces
  * requires: *base*
* [intf](./doc/EntityList.md#intf)  - any logic related to device external interfaces 
  * requires: *base*

It's suggested that you compile ALL files of the areas you need (plus their dependencies) into one VHDL library. You are free to choose any library name and you are also free to use the same single library for *Open Logic* files and user-code.

## Project Philosophy

*Open Logic* is not the first open source VHDL library - so you might ask yourself what makes it different and why you should use this one. The project follows the philosophy below - the decision whether this matches what you are looking for is yours.

### Trustable Code

Open source HDL projects exist but they are by far not as popular as open source software projects. One main problem is that there is little trust in open source HDL code. In some cases code quality is not great and in general RTL designers probably are less used to relying on code from others.

*Open Logic* aims to provide code that can be trusted - and to provide measures that would indicate if this is the case for every individual piece of code in the library. The following measures are implemented:

1. Every entity comes with a testbench.
2. The project comes with a CI workflow, which regularly runs all simulations. The badge on the very top of this page indicates if there is a problem. As long as it is green - you know that all testbenches pass. <br>![example workflow](https://github.com/obruendl/open-logic/actions/workflows/simulation.yml/badge.svg) 
3. Indicators for open issues on every entity. In the documentation of every piece of code, you can find a badge, which informs you about the number of issues related to this piece of code and if there are *potential bugs* (orange color) or even *confirmed bugs* (red color).<br>
   ![issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/issues-0-green) ![issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/issues-2-orange) ![issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/issues-2-red)
4. Indicator for code coverage on every entity. In the documentation of every piece of code, you can find badges stating the code coverage. <br>
   ![Endpoint Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://storage.googleapis.com/open-logic-badges/coverage/olo_base_cc_bits.json?cacheSeconds=0)![Endpoint Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://storage.googleapis.com/open-logic-badges/branches/olo_base_cc_bits.json?cacheSeconds=0)  <br>
   Additionally badges in this readme state when and for which git-commit coverage was last analyzed. <br>

Note that a non-zero number of issues not necessarily is a bad sign - issues include things like feature requests. But probably you at least want to check the issues in detail if the color of the *issues badge* (3) is not green.

### Ease of Use

This goal is self explaining. It is implemented as follows:

* Ease of use instead of feature-creep. Only the logic with a high probability for being used in many places shall go into the library. Each block shall only solve one core topic - whatever can be realized externally is not included to avoid needless complexity and crowded configuration options. 
* Users do not have to care about generics or ports you do not use. Any optional configuration options or ports come with a default value - if you do not have a specific need, you can just omit those and a common default value is used.
* One entity for one thing. Many open source HDL libraries provide multiple entities for the same thing with different implementations. For users it often is difficult to sort out which one to use. *Open Logic* instead provides only one entity with optional generics to achieve the same thing - unless users do want to optimize details, they don't have to care about those details.
* All blocks come with proper markdown documentation. You can easily look up if there is a component that fits your needs, how it is implemented and how you can use it.

### Pure VHDL

*Open Logic* does not rely on vendor specific code (e.g. primitives) and can be compiled to very FPGA. Code is written with different technologies in mind (e.g. using read-before-write or write-before-read blockRAM, containing synthesis attributes for different tools) and hence works efficiently on all devices available and is known to be portable to future device families. Portability to new device families in general does not need any update on the *Open Logic* library.

Thanks to the *pure VHDL* philosophy, *Open Logic* simulates fast and is fully supported by the open-source GHDL simulator. This is crucial for an open-source project because it allows participating on the development at zero tool-cost.

## How to Contribute

Of course you are more than welcome to contribute to the project.

The easiest way of doing so, is by simply using *Open Logic* - and report any issues you find. That may be an idea for a new feature, a bug or simply unclear documentation. Any feedback is appreciated and will help improving the usability of *Open Logic*.

If you want to contribute code, ideally you fork to your own GitHub account and hand in your changes as Pull-Request. You are welcome to discuss your ideas beforehand with (ideally as an issue in GitHub) - this might shorten the path to get your code accepted in *Open Logic*.

## Origin of the Project

The *Open Logic* project is based on the [psi_common](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/psi_common/tree/57aa85217e727b5fbddf8f000b270ab77602b03e) library provided by Paul Scherrer Institute. I would like to give credits to the authors of this library, especially Benoit Stef, who maintained the project after I left PSI.

I decided to create *Open Logic* instead of more actively working on the PSI libraries for the following reasons:

* I want to build a true community project which is not owned by one institution (and clearly labeled as such).
* I want full freedom of applying non-backwards compatible changes where required to improve quality.
* I want full freedom to revise any conceptual decisions I do not (anymore) agree with.

For users switching from *psi_common* to *Open Logic* there is a [Porting Guide](./doc/PsiCommonPorting.md), which describes the correspondences between the two libraries.
